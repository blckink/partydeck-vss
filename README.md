# partydeck-vss

**partydeck-vss** is a fork of [partydeck-rs](https://github.com/wunnr/partydeck-rs), created to further develop and adapt the original project to specific needs.

---

## Purpose

This repository is a personal continuation of the awesome "partydeck-rs" tool. It is aimed at users who require individual customizations or enhancements.

---

## Key Differences from the Original

- Work in progress: Currently, I'm working on implementing a vertical split screen option for 2-player mode, as an alternative to the default static horizontal split.
- Additional customizations and improvements may follow.
- Any further changes will be documented in the changelog.

3. Run the application:

Huge props to [wunnr](https://github.com/wunnr) for creating the original project [partydeck-rs](https://github.com/wunnr/partydeck-rs). He’s behind roughly 99 % of the magic here, and I’ve just sprinkled in a few tiny tweaks for fun.
